# Sonovision: WebGL Exhibition 2020
An online WebGL exhibition for Sonovision UK. This involves speech bubbles, a game with a leaderboard, UI showing images and videos and a first person controller with minimap.

# Design Brief 
- Implement a player controller to allow the player to move and rotate around.
- Implement a minimap so the player can see where they can go.
- Implement a 3D environment with working stalls the player can go to.
- Implement screens for videos within Unity that also work in a WebGL environment.
- Experiment with CAD and introduce low-poly models into the environment for demonstration.
- Integrate a sliding puzzle game with hi-score board for visitors to play.
